# My Personal Project

## Soccer Miniball
My soccer game project will be **a desktop application** that allows users to play a realistic and immersive version of 
the sport of soccer. Users will be able to control and manage their own virtual soccer team, compete against other 
users in matches, and experience the thrill and excitement of playing football from the comfort of their own devices. 
The app will feature detailed graphics and animations, as well as realistic physics and gameplay mechanics. The target 
audience for this application will be soccer fans of all ages and skill levels who want to experience the sport in a 
fun and engaging way.

I am interested in this project because as a developer, I am passionate about creating high-quality and engaging mobile 
games. The sport of soccer is loved by billions of people around the world, and I believe that this game will be able 
to provide a fun and exciting way for users to experience the sport and enjoy the thrill of playing soccer. 
Additionally, this project will also allow me to develop my skills in areas such as game development, physics simulation
and user experience design.

Some of my user stories include:
- As a user, I want to be able to play multiplayer.
- As a user, I want to be able to make up my own team.
- As a user, I want to be able to change players if necessary.
- As a user, I want to be able to create my own kit for the team.
- As a user, I want to be able to change some game settings, for example: game sound and fan sound. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view live statistics and scores for my team and other teams in the league so that I can
stay up-to-date on how my team is performing.
