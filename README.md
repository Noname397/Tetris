# My Personal Project

## Tetris
play the classic puzzle game on their computer. The game will consist of falling tetrominoes that players must arrange in a way that fills complete rows without gaps. As the game progresses, the speed at which the tetrominoes fall will increase, making it more challenging to keep up.

This application will be ideal for anyone who enjoys puzzle games or wants to experience the nostalgia of playing Tetris. It can be played by people of all ages and skill levels, from beginners to experts. It will be a fun and engaging way to pass the time and challenge oneself.

This project is of interest to me because I have always been a fan of puzzle games, and Tetris is one of my favorites. Creating a Java-based application will allow me to combine my passion for gaming with my interest in programming. I am excited to develop my skills as a developer and add my own personal touches to the game, such as custom graphics and sound effects, to make it more engaging for players. Overall, I believe this project will be a fun and rewarding challenge that will allow me to improve my programming skills while creating a game that people can enjoy.
