# My Personal Project

## Tetris
My personal project will be a recreation of the classic puzzle game Tetris. The game will consist of falling tetrominoes that players must arrange in a way that fills complete rows without gaps. As the game progresses, the speed at which the tetrominoes fall will increase, making it more challenging to keep up.

This application will be ideal for anyone who enjoys puzzle games or wants to experience the nostalgia of playing Tetris. It can be played by people of all ages and skill levels, from beginners to experts. It will be a fun and engaging way to pass the time and challenge oneself.

This project is of interest to me because I have always been a fan of puzzle games, and Tetris is one of my favorites. Creating a Java-based application will allow me to combine my passion for gaming with my interest in programming. I believe this project will be a fun and rewarding challenge that will allow me to improve my programming skills while creating a game that people can enjoy.

Some of my user stories include:
- As a user, I want to be able to add and delete users to list of players in the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of players in our league.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the current high-score records for the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the difficulty for the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to change some game settings, for example: game sound and sound effect.
- As a player, I want to be able to pause and resume the game so that I can take a break or attend to other tasks without losing my progress.
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my list of players to file and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my list of players from the file.
